        ago, in 1651, people started to live in an area near a river called
        Ipswich. They got permission to settle there from a town called Reading.
        In 1853, this area officially became its own town called North Reading.
        North Reading is next to other towns like Andover, North Andover,
        Middleton, Lynnfield, Reading, and Wilmington. Back then, about 350
        years ago, a few families came to live here. They had big farms near the
        river. They mostly grew food to eat, like vegetables. There was also a
        sawmill to cut wood by a pond in 1694, and later, more mills to grind
        grains and cut wood. Around 1820, people started to make shoes, and by
        1850, almost every house had a small place to make shoes. They made
        shoes that were not expensive and sold them to people far away. During
        the Civil War in the 1860s, things changed. The town's shoe business
        went down, but they still made things like milk, apples, and other
        fruits in the 1900s. That's how North Reading grew from small farms to a
        town making different things over time! </p>
